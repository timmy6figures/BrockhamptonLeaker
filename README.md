# BrockhamptonLeaker

## About

A tool used to download all of the links from this sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gM4-rRghgRUBr2cgWNsh-nawlUuh43guAM63dYVTdt8/htmlview#

Although this could have been done manually, I thought I may as well create a bot to do it because auto-downloading 400 links from a google sheet seems like the kind of thing I was destined to do, and destined to do more than once. I will probably make this into a more general purpose tool in the future.

## Usage

Place all links to download inside of "links_to_download.txt"
in the same directory as BrockhamptonLeaker.py, then run BrockhamptonLeaker.py

## Future updates

The next obvious step is to auto-grab the links from the sheet. Some other improvements would be:

- Running the program multiple times skips files already downloaded
- Download images as well
- More general functions
