# BrockhamptonLeaker

A tool used to download all of the files from this sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gM4-rRghgRUBr2cgWNsh-nawlUuh43guAM63dYVTdt8/htmlview#

Although this could have been done manually, I thought I may as well create a bot to do it because auto-downloading links from a google sheet seems like the kind of thing that is pretty useful, and I will proobably make this into a more general purpose tool in the future.

## Usage

Place all links to download inside of "links_to_download.txt"
in the same directory as BrockhamptonLeaker.py, then run BrockhamptonLeaker.py
