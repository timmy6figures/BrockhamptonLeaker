# BrockhamptonLeaker

## About

A tool used to download all of the links from this sheet:  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gM4-rRghgRUBr2cgWNsh-nawlUuh43guAM63dYVTdt8/htmlview#

Although this could have been done manually, I thought I may as well create a bot to do it because auto-downloading 400 links from a google sheet is the perfect use case for a Python script

## Usage

Place all links to download inside of "links_to_download.txt"
in the same directory as BrockhamptonLeaker.py, then run BrockhamptonLeaker.py

## Future updates

No updates are currently planned, but the next obvious step is to auto-grab the links from the sheet. Some other improvements would be:

- Running the program multiple times skips files already downloaded
- Download images as well
- More general functions
